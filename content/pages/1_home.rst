**Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (DCM)** is a major cause of disability for many patients. It involves degenerative changes in
the spinal column that can lead to compression of the spinal cord, resulting in neurological symptoms and disability.
The prevalence of DCM in Europe is estimated to be present in **up to 5% of the general population**.
DCM has a remarkable impact on public health.

Mechanical stress on the spinal cord, caused by degenerative pathology of the spinal column, combined with time,
can lead to spinal cord injury. Vulnerability factors influence an individual's ability to resist such injury or
develop symptoms as a result. Understanding these factors is crucial for effective management of DCM.
**FEM (Finite Element Method) is being used to study spinal cord injury**, trauma, pathologic processes, and spine surgery.
However, there is considerable variation in modeling parameters, anatomical structures, and the inclusion of patient-specific data.
Improving standardization and incorporating patient-specific data could enhance the clinical utility of FEM in understanding DCM
and guiding treatment strategies.

About Project
-----------------

We will implement a large-scale finite element simulation on **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** systems using advanced continuum and
discrete modeling techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the biomechanical aspects of DCM. This could potentially lead to
better treatment planning and optimization of surgical interventions. The combination of clinical, neurophysiological (perioperative
nTMS and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring) and high-resolution anatomical data, combined with FEM simulation and HPC,
will allow us to characterize in unprecedented ways the relationship between pathophysiological properties and clinical features
of the myelopatic cord.

Such characterization will have the potential to tailor surgical indications as well as refine prognostic factors, allowing the
personalization of both the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients affected by cervical myelopathy.
Overall, the integration of advanced computational modeling techniques with clinical data holds promise for **improving the
management and outcomes of patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy**.
