#### Participation at 11th Serbian Neurosurgical Society (SNSS) Meeting, Ethico-legal aspect of neurosurgery in the 21st century: Challenges and opportunities

##### Novi Sad, Serbia, October 23–26, 2025

At the 11th Serbian Neurosurgical Society (SNSS) Annual Meeting — "Ethico-Legal Aspects of Neurosurgery in the 21st Century: Challenges and Opportunities" held in Novi Sad, Serbia (October 23–26, 2025) - **Professor Nenad Filipović** presented the latest work on patient-specific modeling of the spine using artificial intelligence and finite element methods on behalf on all three participating institutions: University of Kragujevac, Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade and University of Verona.

The presented study, **Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Finite Element Method to Advance Patient-Specific Modeling of the Spine**, explores how advanced deep learning models — including U-Net and hybrid transformer-based architectures — can automate the segmentation of spinal structures from MRI data with high precision. These AI-driven models are then coupled with large-scale FEM simulations on high-performance computing systems to analyze biomechanical parameters such as stress distribution and displacement within the cervical spine.
